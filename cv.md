**<center>INTRODUCTION</center>**
    
I have always had a keen interest in the field of economics (social sciences in general). Throughout my four years of working on different research projects for academic institutions, I have been leveraging the power of data to understand various social and economic problems of our times. Until about an year ago, my experience had been within academics, mostly running statistical tests for associations and testing hypotheses using Stata. However eventually, mostly out of curiosity and interest, I saw myself venturing into the many related fields such as artificial neural networks, natural language processing and others within the larger field of machine learning. Now, I am a data science enthusiast with a wide ranging skill-set, and wider learning quotient.

My data-science education was mostly through free online tutorials, blog-posts etc. I learned the skills by doing  individual projects and by collaborating with friends. Some which you may check <a href="data_science.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> 

I am currently pursuing a Data Science Career Path certificate programe by Codecademy. I am about 85% through the program. 
    
I intend to use the knowledge I gained by working in academia and the skills I picked up along the way to help organizations and people find solutions to their problems.

**<center>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</center>**

**Research Associate \|Mizuho India-Japan Study Center, Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore**

***November 2021 - Present***

As a research associate at Mizuho India-Japan Study Center, I am primarily involved in developing a software platform where Small Manufacturing Entreprises and Start-ups in


**Data Analyst \| NSRCEL (on a project for Goldman Sachs 10K Women Programme, full time)**

***August 2021 - Present***

At NSRCEL, a startup incubation center in IIM-Bangalore, my primary resposibility was to anlayze a survey data on women entreprenuers. My objectives were to identify challenges the participants face in their entreprenueship journeys and the efficacy of the program in addressing those challenges. I mostly used *python* for the purpose. I used *pandas*, *numpy*, *regex* (for data wrangling, cleaning and merging together separate datasheets), *matplotlib*, *seaborn* and *plotly* (for vizualization), *sklearn* and *sentence_transformers* (for summarizing and clustering qualitative responses). The results I got were then communicated to the team via presentations created using *LibreOffice Impress*. 

**Academic Associate \| Indian Institute of Managament, Bangalore (full time)**

***2018 August - 2021 July***

As an Academic Associate, I have worked as *teaching assistant* and *research assistant* to many professors of Economics and Social Sciences department in IIM-B. 

I have worked on projects in the area of trade in services, international migration, and remittances. I have an intitutive understanding of where to look for the relevant data to probe questions in this field. I am well acquainted with datasets such as *World Bank Open database*, *UNCTAD*, *UN DESA*, *OECD database*, *CEPII* etc. I am adept at extracting data from separate datasets, cleaning them and merging them to form final datasets as per relevant econometric models. I have a good understanding of various econometric estimation methods ranging from the basic *OLS estimation techniques* for regular linear models to more complex techniques such as *Heckman sample selection estimators* for *panel-gravity* models of migration, trade, remittances etc. 

I have also worked in the area of behavioral economics. I worked on a project that probed the hypothesis that women employees tend to volunteer for non-promotable tasks more than men. (Non-promotable tasks are those tasks that benefit the organization as a whole, but do not contribute  to the individual’s career advancement). This hypothesis was tested upon data generated through experiments conducted across few colleges in India. I was primarily involved in the vizualizations of the results, analysis of the data (statistical tests for association between variables, and maximum likelihood method on a probit model for hypothesis testing). It was done using python (chiefly *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *statsmodels*) and *Stata*. 

I have worked closely with an eminent econometrician for a panel data econometric methods workshop that was conducted by IIM-B. I assisted the faculty in developing sample exercises that were then worked-out as tutorials at the workshop. A bilateral services trade model (which I had helped put together for an earlier project) was used for the purpose, and various econometric analyses were done on it for the audience. The software used was *Stata*. Having participated in the workshop both as a student and as well as an RA was a wonderful learning experience for me. 

As a TA, I have worked closely with professors on numerous teaching assignments, assisting them by completing various tasks such as preparing reviews of academic literature, closely reading news articles to prepare case studies for classroom teaching, taking tutorials for students of management studies, evaluating students' answer scripts etc.

Working in IIM-B was a fantastic experience for the learner in me, as it gave me access to numerous lectures, workshops, chance to audit courses etc. I believe I have been able to take advantage of the opportunities that the place provided. 

**Research Assistant \| Center for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala (full time)**

***2017 July - 2018 March***

During my stint as an RA at CDS, I was involved in a project where we studied intergenerational occupational mobility in India and Kerala. I was introduced to large scale datasets for the first time at this job. I worked extensively with *National Sample Survey Office’s Employment-Unemployment* datasets (various rounds) to extract the data relevant to our question. Other datasets used were *The India KLEMS database (Reserve Bank of India)* and few other datasets of primary surveys conducted by CDS. Stata was used for extractring the necessary data, and for summarizing the data using descriptive statistics.

I collaborated with the same professor for another project few years later as a part time RA. Together we updated a report by *International Labour Organization* on wages in India with latest available data. The datasets primarily used were *National Sample Survey Office’s  Periodic Labor Force Survey 2018-19, Employment-Unemployment Survey 2011-12*. Stata was used for extracting the necessary variables from these large-scale datasets, manipulation and summarizing them using descriptive statistics.

During my stint at CDS I was a regular at workshops, lectures etc that were open to me. The environment there helped me shape my interests, and motivated me to become a researcher. It was during this period (in November 2017) that I cleared the *National Eligibility Test for Economoics* which forms an important part of the qualifications required to work as an assistant professor of economics in colleges of India.

**<center>EDUCATION</center>**

**Master of Arts (Economics)** \| **Madras University, Tamil Nadu**

***2013 - 2015***

I hold a post graduate degree in Economcis from Madras Christian College, Tambaram. I graduated with a first class (66.4%) in the year of 2015.

I analysed the Socio-Economic profiles of migrant labourers in seafood processing firms in Alappuzha, Kerala for my dissertation. The project also had a gender aspect to it, as I included a comparative analysis of male and female labourers. The data used for the essay were collected through a primary survey on a total 70 laborers from seven seafood processing units in Cochin, during my two month stint (May-June 2014) as an intern at Central Institute of Fisheries Technology, Cochin. Summary statisitcs were calculated and reported using SPSS. 

I held the position of Co-convenor of Annual Inter-collegiate Economics Fest, Artha in my first year of Masters. I absolutely enjoyed co-ordinating the three day fest with the large team, and fulfilled my responsibilites with zeal. In my second year of masters, I was promoted to the position of Convenor of Artha (based on popular vote), and I worked with equal zeal and commitment as the previous year. 

**Bachelor of Arts (History-Economics-Political Science)** \| **Bangalore University, Karnataka**

***2010 - 2013***

I hold an under-graduate degree in History, Economics and Political Science (triple major) from St Josephs' College of Arts and Science, Bangalore. I graduated in the year 2013 with a first class (66.6%). 

My final year project was a critical analysis of ‘Kerala Model of Development’ and its contemporary relevance. The methodology I followed for the study was content-anlaysis (of documentaries, texts, news articles etc) and a review of academic literature. 

During the three years I studied at the insitution, I was an active participant of various clubs of diverse nature. I was an active member of the Economics club ('Eco Forum'), participant in quizzes conducted by Histroy club ('Parishodana'), participant in debates held by Political Science club ('Spectrum'), while also being member of National Service Scheme (NSS). As a member of NSS, I have taught English lessons for students of lesser privileges of St. Micheals School in Bangalore for three months. That is an experience I hold close to my heart. 

I have also completed two 120 hours certificate courses, one in english literature titled ‘History of Ideas’ (orgnaized by  St. Josephs College of Arts and Science, Bangalore) and another on law titled ‘Legal Literacy’ (organized by National Law School of India University, Bangalore and St. Josephs College of Arts and Science, Bangalore). This is in addition to numerous workshops and seminars that I attended during the period. The insitution gave us a wide variety of opportunities to explore and cultivate our interests, or to quote my favorite professor, "to make the platter more appetizing".

I am very keen on programing and coding, and I am commited to keeping myself up-to-date with the very dynamic changes. I love learning. My good friends will be able to vouch for the enthusiasm I have for learning and creating, that I display when I try to help them solve their academic and analysis related problems. 

This very website is an example of a private-project of mine which I did using freely available resources in the internet. I am thankful to Len Paul for providing the basic <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jekyll template</a> which was a great starting point.

I am a huge fan of opensource! I run an Ubuntu on my personal laptop and extensively use python to automate many tasks. I do not mean to discredit proprietory softwares, as I rely on many of them on any given day, and I think many of them are fantastic (*Stata*, *Tableau*, *Microsoft Excel* etc).
