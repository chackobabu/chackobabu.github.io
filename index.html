      Hello there, thank you for visiting my website! 
      <br><br>My name is Chacko Babu. I currently work as a Research Associate for Mizuho India-Japan Study Center, Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. Before this I was an Academic Associate in the department of Economics and Social Sciences of the same institution. I graduated with a masters degree in economics from Madras University (Madras Christian College) in the year 2015. 
      <br><br>Apart from working with data extensively on empirical academic research projects, I have freelanced as a data analyst/data scientist for few organizations. I also carry out projects on my own using publicly available datasets. My research interests are mostly in the field of Political Economy, Economics of Health and Education, International Trade and Migration. 
      <br><br>You may check out some of my research and data science projects on this website.
