    Hello there!
    <br><br>I am Chacko Babu, a <strong>data scientist</strong> and a<strong> Python programmer</strong> based in Bangalore,
    India. I currently work at <strong>Euromonitor International</strong> as a data analyst. As an experienced professional who has worked with data across various domains&mdash;academia, freelancing, and corporate settings&mdash;I am well versed with handling data at various stages of the problem-solving cycle: from collection, management and cleaning to analysis and hypothesis generation to interpretation and communication. 
    <br><br>I enjoy programming in general and have developed strong proficiency in it through a variety of projects and
    experiences. I am a fan of markup (also markdown) languages, and enjoy building things (such as these web pages, web applications etc) using code.
    <br><br>My background in <strong>economics</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong> drives me to explore
    socioeconomic data to better understand the world around us. This passion leads me to avidly follow data-driven
    stories in the media and conduct my own analyses.
    <br><br>My hobbies form an important part of my life. I greatly enjoy drawing and painting, reading novels and watching movies. I also like to go on moderately long cycle rides in and around Bengaluru. 
    <br><br>Thank you for visiting my page. You may download my<a href="/assets/ChackoBabu_Aug2024.pdf" target="_blank"> resume</a> here. You can reach me at chackobabun-at-gmail-dot-com if you wish to dicsuss anything with me.
