      Hello there! 
      <br><br>I am Chacko Babu, a <strong>data analyst</strong> and <strong>Python programmer</strong> based in Bangalore, India. I currently work at <strong>Euromonitor International</strong> as a data analyst. I have over 8 years of experience working with data across various domains; academia, freelancing, and corporate settings.  
      <br><br>I enjoy programming in general and have developed strong proficiency through a variety of projects and experiences. I mostly code in <strong>Python</strong> and use it to develop web-applications, automate Excel, among other tasks at work.
      <br><br>My background in <strong>economics</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong> drives me to explore socioeconomic data to better understand the world around us. This passion leads me to avidly follow data-driven stories in the media and conduct my own analyses.
